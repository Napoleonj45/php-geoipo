PHP GeoIP OOP (geoipo)
An object oriented PHP module for GeoIP from Maxmind.

This project has been built to solve two problems of the current geoip module
for PHP.

1) Be Object Oriented
2) Allow custom directories to be set outside of PHP.INI.

To do this the original would have required too much refactoring, so I have
I have built this from the ground up.

Demo of it working on FreeBSD with PHP with ZTS:

Completed API:

	Static Methods
	string  GeoIP::getDatabaseFile(int dbid);
	string  GeoIP::getDatabaseInfo(int dbid);
	boolean GeoIP::hasDatabase(int dbid);
	void    GeoIP::init(optional string directory);
	
	Instance Properties
	string  GeoIP->host

	Instance Methods
	object  GeoIP->__construct(optional string host);
	string  GeoIP->getContinentCode(void);
	string  GeoIP->getCountryCode(optional int len);
	string  GeoIP->getCountryName(void);
	int     GeoIP->getID(void);
	string  GeoIP->getISP(void);
	object  GeoIP->getRecord(void);
	object  GeoIP->getRegion(void);

Requirements:
	
	* GeoIP C API Library from MaxMind (http://www.maxmind.com/app/c)
	* Installed GeoIP Databases (if you actually want results...)

Really Important Notes:

	The original php-geoip must not be loaded at the same time as this module.
	I am not being anti-competitive. The libgeoip from MaxMind only allows you
	to define the custom directory once, and once it is set you cannot change it
	and it is locked for the entire duration of the application. If the original
	php-geoip loads before this module then it will lock you to the system paths
	by default. Half the reason this module was written was so that you could set
	the path per application without editing php.ini.
	
	So, php-geoip (the original) or php-geoipo (this) pick one not both.

Other Important Notes:
	
	I have no Windows machines. There is no Windows build script nor do I
	know how to write one or how to Windows Windows Windows.
	
	Tested On:
		OS X Lion with the PHP it comes with and libGeoIP from source.
		Ubuntu 11.04 with PHP and libGeoIP from the repositories.
		FreeBSD 8 with PHP and libGeoIP from ports.
	
	On UNIX style systems, the GeoIP database are usually found in
	/usr/share/GeoIP, /usr/local/share/GeoIP, or some other path similar to
	that. You will need to create that directory, make sure it has read
	permissions, and extract your MaxMind databases into it.
	
	MaxMind provides two free databases that are updated only once a month,
	but will probably be more than good enough to get you rolling:
	
	* http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz
	* gunzip it and put it where it needs to be.

	* http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
	* gunzip it, rename it to GeoIPCity.dat, and put it where it needs to be.

Build Instructions

This compiles just like any other module for PHP. Therefore you will need the
PHP dev packages for your system installed if you did not compile your own PHP
from source.

	1) install libGeoIP.
		* FreeBSD: /usr/ports/net/GeoIP
		* Ubuntu: apt-get install libgeoip1 libgeoip-dev
		* Else: http://www.maxmind.com/app/c
		
	2) install php-geoipo
		* phpize && ./configure
		* make
		* make install
		
	3) add geoipo.so to your php.ini. and of course reload the webserver to
	   reload the changes to the config if needed.
