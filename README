PHP GeoIP OOP (geoipo)
An object oriented PHP module for GeoIP from Maxmind.

This project has been built to solve two problems of the current geoip module
for PHP.

1) Be Object Oriented
2) Allow custom directories to be set outside of PHP.INI.

To do this the original would have required too much refactoring, so I have
I have built this from the ground up.

Demo of it working on FreeBSD with PHP with ZTS:
	* http://zenthis.org/tests/geoip.php
	* there is a link at the bottom to view the source.

Quick How-To for setting up and using geoipo.

Installing with PECL/PEAR:
	* pecl channel-discover pecl.squirrelshaterobots.com
	* pecl install shr/geoipo

	* Installed GeoIP Databases (if you actually want results...)

Really Important Notes:
	
	It used to be important that both geoip and geoipo were not loaded at
	the same time, but I believes that no longer matters due to advances
	this module has made.
	
--------

Other Important Notes:
	
	I have no Windows machines. There is no Windows build script nor do I
	know how to write one or how to Windows Windows Windows.
	
	Tested On:
		OS X Lion with the PHP it comes with and libGeoIP from source.

		Ubuntu 11.04 with PHP from the repo and libGeoIP from source. While
		the package version number is correct something is wrong with
		Ubuntu's package for libGeoIP that it seems to be missing a core
		function in the library. Compiling the library from MaxMind's official
		source with --prefix=/usr fixes the problem.

		FreeBSD 8 with PHP (ZTS) and libGeoIP from ports.
	
	On UNIX style systems, the GeoIP database are usually found in
	/usr/share/GeoIP, /usr/local/share/GeoIP, or some other path similar to
	that. You will need to create that directory, make sure it has read
	permissions, and extract your MaxMind databases into it.
	
	MaxMind provides two free databases that are updated only once a month,
	but will probably be more than good enough to get you rolling:
	
	* http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz
	* gunzip it and put it where it needs to be.

	* http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
	* gunzip it, rename it to GeoIPCity.dat, and put it where it needs to be.

Build Instructions

This compiles just like any other module for PHP. Therefore you will need the
PHP dev packages for your system installed if you did not compile your own PHP
from source.

	1) install libGeoIP.
		* FreeBSD: /usr/ports/net/GeoIP
		* Ubuntu: apt-get install libgeoip1 libgeoip-dev
		* Else: http://www.maxmind.com/app/c
		
	2) install php-geoipo
		* phpize && ./configure
		* make
		* make install
		
	3) add geoipo.so to your php.ini. and of course reload the webserver to
	   reload the changes to the config if needed.
